Introduction
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds using regression analysis. The dataset contains various attributes of diamonds that can influence their price.

About the Data
The dataset includes the following independent variables:

id: Unique identifier for each diamond.
carat: Weight measurement exclusive to gemstones and diamonds (Carat - ct.).
cut: Quality of the diamond cut.
color: Color grade of the diamond.
clarity: Measure of the purity and rarity of the diamond.
depth: Height of the diamond (in millimeters) from the culet to the table.
table: Facet visible when the stone is viewed face up.
x: Diamond X dimension.
y: Diamond Y dimension.
z: Diamond Z dimension.
Target Variable
price: Price of the given diamond.
Data Source
The dataset used in this project may be sourced from [mention the data source or provide a link if applicable].

Project Workflow
Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset, checking for missing values, and exploring statistical summaries.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if required.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Building: Training and evaluating regression models to predict diamond prices.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
Deployment: Making the model available for predictions, possibly through a web interface or API.
